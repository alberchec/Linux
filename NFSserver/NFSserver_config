To run a NFS server you need to install nfs-kernel-server:
sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server

Then create an NFS Export Directory:
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs_share

Remove directory restrictions, so all the client machines can access the shared directory:
sudo chown -R nobody:nogroup /mnt/nfs_share

Permissions for accessing NFS server are defined in the /etc/exports file:
open /etc/exports and then write the rules:
/mnt/nfs_share 192.168.1.4(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,insecure)
or apply to entire subnet "192.168.1.0/24"

Now you have to export the NFS share directory and restart the server:
sudo exportfs -a
sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server

And finally allow NFS access through firewall if enabled
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port nfs
sudo ufw enable (reload firewall)

PS: NFS operates at port 2049
