Connect to Wi-Fi via wpa_supplicant.
To connect to a wpa2 protected wi-fi is necessary to use this program.

First we need to create the file /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
We can do that by using the command:
wpa_passphrase your-ESSID your-passphrase | sudo tee /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf

If the Wi-Fi doesn't broadcast its SSID, it's necessary to add the following line to the wpa_supplicant.conf file:
scan_ssid=1 (below psk)

To connect to the access point type the command:
sudo wpa_supplicant -B -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -i interface

Next it's needed to receive an ip address from the DHCP server:
sudo dhclient interface

To disconnect:
sudo dhclient interface -r (releases the ip address)
Then:
ps aux | grep wpa_supplicant
This will give you the process a process number and then:
sudo kill process_number
